# Loksabha-Election-2024-Result-Data-Analysis
Loksabha Election 2024 Result Data Analysis | Python Project

Topics covered in this python tutorial:

Loading Data: We'll start by showing you how to load election results from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. You'll understand the structure of the data and how to manipulate it effectively.

Data Analysis: Next, we'll dive into the core analysis. You'll learn techniques to calculate the total votes each candidate received and determine the percentage share of the total votes. This fundamental analysis will set the stage for more complex insights.

Visualization: Data is best understood when visualized. We'll create various visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, to present our findings. These visual tools will help you communicate the results clearly and effectively.

State-wise Analysis: Breaking down the results state-wise adds another layer of depth to our analysis. You'll learn how to group data by state and candidate, then visualize the distribution of votes across different states. This segment is crucial for understanding regional patterns and trends in the election data.

Tools and Libraries:
Python: Our programming language of choice for its simplicity and powerful data manipulation capabilities.
Pandas: This library is essential for data analysis and manipulation, making it easy to load and transform our dataset.
Matplotlib: A versatile plotting library that will help us create various types of visualizations to represent our data effectively.
